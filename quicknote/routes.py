QuickNote Application Module

Description:
    This module serves as a central component of the QuickNote application,
    containing the main routes and functionality for user registration, login,
    note management, and user authentication.
    It imports necessary modules, such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Login,
    to implement the application's core features.
    The module defines routes, views, and database interactions for creating,
    editing, and viewing notes, as well as user registration and login.

    Dependencies:
    - Flask: A web framework for building the application.
    - SQLAlchemy: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database
      operations.
    - Flask-Login: A Flask extension for managing user sessions and
      authentication.
    - werkzeug.security: Provides password hashing and verification functions.
    - datetime: Used for date and time operations.
    - quicknote.models: Contains the data models for users and notes.

    Use this module as the main entry point for running the QuickNote
    application.

    Route function for handling user registration and redirection.

    If the current user is authenticated, redirects to the 'notes' page.
    If the request method is POST, it retrieves user registration data from the
    form, validates the input, and creates a new user if the data is valid.
    If the email provided already exists in the database, it flashes an
    error message.
    Otherwise, it checks and validates the input data such as email, first name,
    last name, and passwords.
    If all validations pass, a new user is created, added to the database,
    and the user is logged in.
    It then redirects to the 'notes' page after a successful account creation.

    Returns:
        If the user is already authenticated, redirects to 'notes'.
        If the request method is POST and all input validations pass,
        redirects to 'notes' after account creation.
        Otherwise, renders the 'home.html' template for user registration.

    Dependencies:
        - current_user: User authentication status.
        - request: Retrieves form data and method type (POST).
        - redirect: Redirects to a specified route.
        - url_for: Generates URLs for a specific function.
        - flash: Displays flashed messages for different categories
          (success or error).
        - User: Represents the User model for interaction with the database.
        - generate_password_hash: Hashes the user's password for security.
        - login_user: Logs in the user.
        - db: Represents the database session.
        - render_template: Renders the HTML template for user registration.

    HTML Templates:
        - 'home.html': Contains the user registration form.

    Note:
        - This function assumes the existence of a User model and an
          'home.html' template.
        - It employs Flask and its extensions for web functionalities.
