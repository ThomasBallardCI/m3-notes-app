QuickNote Data Models Module

Description:
    This module defines the data models used in the QuickNote application.
    It includes the UserMixin class, which provides user management
    functionality and interfaces required for user sessions and authentication.
    The module also defines a set of data models for the application,
    such as the 'User' and 'Note' models.

    Dependencies:
    - flask_login.UserMixin: Provides user management functionality for the
      application.
    - sqlalchemy.sql.func: Provides SQL functions for database operations.
    - quicknote.db: The database instance used to interact with the database.

    Use this module to define and manage the data models used by the QuickNote
    application.
