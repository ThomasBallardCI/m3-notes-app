* Accessible on multiple devices via the device's web browser (Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile) to access notes while on the move.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

* To create, edit, view, delete, and store notes easily and quickly.
* To be able to view notes on multiple platforms.

#### First-Time Visitor Goals

* To be able to easily create an account and create their first note.
* To understand how to edit and delete the users' notes.
* To be able to quickly and easily view their notes.
* To be able to easily understand how to delete their account if needed.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Landing/Welcome Page__

  - The welcome page is designed to provide the user with a summary of the app and a clear registration form to sign up directly from the page or click the 'Login!' link to log in to an existing account.

- __Notes Page__

  - The Notes page is designed to provide the user with a clear and easily accessible button for creating a new note. Once the notes are created, they are displayed to the user within a collapsible element. This display includes the note's title and creation date, allowing the user to expand their preferred note for editing, deletion, or viewing its contents. This design aims to maximize the efficient use of the available screen space.

- __Edit Note Page__

  - The Edit page is designed to enable the user to edit the title and content of a chosen specific note, updating the existing note and moving it to the top of the notes page.

- __Delete Notes__

  - The 'Delete Notes' button opens a modal to prompt user confirmation for deletion, ensuring a reduction in accidental deletion of notes.

- __Account Page__

  - The Account page is a simple interface that allows the user to delete their account and the corresponding notes. It provides straightforward instructions, a warning, and two buttons: 'Back to Notes' and 'Delete Account.' When the user selects 'Delete Account,' a confirmation modal will appear to reduce the risk of accidental deletion before the account is permanently removed. The 'Back to Notes' button, alternatively, directs the user back to their notes page.

- __Modals__

  - Modals are used to confirm user actions, serving to reduce the likelihood of accidental actions by the user. They are implemented for functions such as note deletion, account deletion, and logging out.

### Future Features

- __Search Notes__

  - Given additional time or as an update to the app, I believe a valuable addition would be to grant users the ability to search their notes using keywords. This feature would greatly assist in easily locating specific notes, especially for users managing a large volume of stored notes.

- __Set Notes to Important__

  - Given more time or as an update to the app, I believe that enabling users to mark and set notes as important, always displaying them at the top, would greatly enhance the app's value and user experience.

## Design

### Initial Concept

The primary design concept aimed to create a clear and easily readable website with high contrast. It includes a splash of colour for highlighting key points and buttons, providing users with a clean, crisp, and easy-to-navigate experience.

### Colour Scheme

The chosen neutral colour scheme of whites and blacks, along with drop shadows, and the use of Indigo for action buttons and links, was selected to improve visual clarity while maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

This project was deployed to Heroku via Elephant SQL using the following steps:

#### ElephantSQL

1. Navigate to ElephantSQL.com and create a user account, using the login with GitHub option.
2. Click “Create New Instance”.
3. Set up your plan. (You can leave the 'tags' field blank.)
4. Select region.
5. Select a data center near you
6. Then click “Review”.
7. Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”.
8. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project
9. In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard
10. Leave this tab open, we will come back here later

#### Heroku

1. Log into Heroku.com and click “New” and then “Create a new app”.
2. Choose a unique name for your app, select the region closest to you and click “Create app”.
3. Go to the Settings tab of your new app
4. Click Reveal Config Vars
5. Return to your ElephantSQL tab and copy your database URL
6. Back on Heroku, add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL and paste your ElephantSQL database URL in as the value. Make sure you click “Add.”
7. Add each of your other environment variables except DEVELOPMENT and DB_URL from the env.py file as a Config Var.
8. Navigate to the “Deploy” tab of your app.
9. In the Deployment method section, select “Connect to GitHub”.
10. Search for your repo and click Connect
11. Optional: You can click Enable Automatic Deploys in case you make any further changes to the project. This will trigger any time code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
12. As we already have all our changes pushed to GitHub, we will use the Manual Deploy section and click Deploy Branch. This will start the build process.
13. Now, we have our project in place, and we have an empty database ready for use. As you may remember from our local development, we still need to add our tables to our database. To do this, we can click the “More” button and select “Run console.”
14. Type python3 into the console and click Run
15. In the terminal that opens, write "from quicknote import db" and then press enter.
16. In the terminal, write "db.create_all()" and then press enter.
17. Exit the Python terminal, by typing exit() and hitting enter, and close the console. Our Heroku database should now have the tables and columns created from our models.py file.
18. The app should be up and running now, so click the “Open app” button

## Testing

Testing was an ongoing process as I built out the Quick Notes application, utilizing Chrome Developer Tools with console logging to ensure I was getting the required responses from the code as it was written.
There are two types of testing methods available: 'Manual' and 'Automated.' Both have been used in some form throughout the creation of the website questionnaire.

- __Manual Testing__ Is done by an individual to see if they can use the product in a way that creates, finds, and results in bugs, or not, to ensure it behaves correctly for the user when pushed live.

- __Automated Testing__ Is done by utilizing an automation framework or another tool or software suite to check for errors and bugs in code.

### Test Cases and Results

  - Chrome Developer tools were used to fully test the site and its functionality throughout the development process, in combination with console logs as code was written, to ensure it was functioning correctly. The Chrome Developer tools were also used to test responsiveness for mobile and tablet device-specific styling before moving on to functionality testing on those devices physically.

#### Button

  - Testing of all buttons was carried out on all platforms to ensure they took you to the relevant section, opened or closed the correct modals and submitted the information correctly (user registration and note create/edit).

#### Input Field

  - Testing of the input fields was done by passing them characters below and above the limits set for each input field.

#### Authentication

  - Authentication was tested by creating a user account and ensuring when logged in the user can only see the relevant sections of the app.
    - Nav bar elements "Notes" "Account" "Logout"
    - Pages "Notes" "Account"
    - Actions "creating notes" "editing notes" "deleting notes" "deleting account"
    - Views Users can only view, edit and delete the notes they have created as well as only able to delete the account they have created whilst logged in
    - Returning user if logged in will be directed to their notes page

#### Database

- User Account data is added and persists over time
- User Note data is added and persists over time
- User Notes are edited correctly
- User Notes are deleted correctly
- User Account is deleted correctly
